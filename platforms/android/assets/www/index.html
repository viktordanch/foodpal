                for our network. Restaurant partners increase sales with a hassle-free program
                ordering service.

<h3>TERMS OF USE FOR CUSTOMERS</h3>

<h3>TERMS OF USE AGREEMENT</h3>

This Terms of Use Agreement ("Agreement") constitutes a legally binding agreement made
between the user and Foodpal, LLC and its affiliated companies (collectively, "Foodpal”),
concerning your access to and use of the www.Foodpal.com website as well as any other
related media form or channel (collectively, the "Website"). The Website allows
restaurants ("Restaurants") to market and offer for sale meals for delivery and/or
pick-up and customers to search for and purchase such meals ("Foodpal Services").
The Foodpal Services are hosted in the United States.
<br/>
<br/>

All users of the Website who are minors in the jurisdiction in which they reside
(generally under the age of 18) must have the permission of, and be directly supervised
by, a parent or guardian. If you are a minor, you must have your parent or guardian
read and agree to this Agreement prior to you using the Website. Anyone under the age
of 13 cannot register to use the Website Services.
<br/>
<br/>

YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT BY ACKNOWLEDGING SUCH ACCEPTANCE
DURING THE REGISTRATION PROCESS (IF APPLICABLE) AND ALSO BY USING THE WEBSITE.
IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ABIDE BY THIS AGREEMENT, OR TO MODIFICATIONS FOODOPAL MAY MAKE TO
THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT USE OR ACCESS THE FOODPAL SERVICES OR WEBSITE.
<h3>OUR PURPOSE</h3>

We have created the Website to serve as a marketplace. Foodpal is a merchant of food
ordering and delivery services. Foodpal does not sell or control the production of any
food produced at the Restaurants.
<br/>
<br/>

Restaurants are obligated by Foodpal to comply with federal, state, and local laws and
regulations pertaining to food preparation, sale, marketing, and safety. Foodpal does not
independently verify the Restaurant’s credentials, representations, or products, the
ingredients or quality of products, or that a Restaurant is in compliance with applicable
laws. Buyers must take the necessary steps to independently inform themselves as to
the Restaurant’s quality, reliability, and compliance with applicable laws.
Additionally, a Restaurant may represent that food preparation is in accordance
with special standards such as "organic," "kosher," "macrobiotic" or allergen-specific
standards such as "nut-free," "gluten-free," or "lactose-free." Foodpal does not
independently investigate or verify such representations. Foodpal shall not be liable
or responsible for any food or services offered by Restaurants that is unhealthy,
causes injury, or is otherwise unacceptable or does not meet the buyer’s expectations.
Buyers are also solely responsible for verifying the accuracy of delivery addresses,
and Foodpal shall have no liability or responsibility for erroneous addresses.
<br/>
<br/>
<em>Please direct all complaints concerning Restaurants to Foodpal 's attention as indicated
    on the Website.</em>

<h3>ORDERING AND PAYMENT</h3>

All ordering is performed online. Foodpal bills buyers directly for their orders, and
"Foodpal " will be the name that appears on buyer’s payment records, but Foodpal shall
not be considered the seller of food. On occasion, credit card information may be
provided to the Restaurants, and in such case, the Restaurant will bill the buyer
directly. The buyer will be notified at the time of purchase if the Restaurant will be
billing directly. In such case, the buyer authorizes Foodpal to transfer your credit
card information to the Restaurant for processing.

<h3>REFUND POLICY</h3>

Foodpal takes customer satisfaction seriously. In the event a buyer has problems with
the food order, please contact the Restaurant directly. If the Restaurant is unable to
resolve your issue, please contact Foodpal and we will try to assist you.
<h3>GIFT CARDS</h3>

If Foodpal offers gift cards, the following terms will apply: (1) gift cards cannot be
combined with cash, (2) gift cards are redeemable only with online payments; (3) gift
cards are not redeemable for cash, (4) lost, stolen, or damaged gift cards may be
replaced only with valid proof of purchase and only to the extent that the remaining
gift card balance appears in Foodpal 's records, (5) gift cards are not a credit or debit
card, (6) there are no expiration dates and no fees for purchased gift cards, and (7)
expiration dates or other terms may apply to promotional or service credit gift cards
not purchased directly by a consumer.

If you believe your own copyrighted material has been removed from the Website as a result of
mistake or misidentification, you may submit a written counter notification ("Counter Notification")
to our Designated Copyright Agent under DMCA 17 U.S.C. § 512(g)(2) and (3). Your Counter
Notification must include substantially the following:
<br/>
<br/>

<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identification of the material that has been removed or disabled and
    the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or disabled. </p>

<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal

You may submit your Counter Notification to our Copyright Agent by fax, mail, or e-mail as set forth
above.
<br/>
<br/>
If you send Foodpal a written Counter Notification meeting the requirements described above, we will
restore your removed or disabled material after 10 business days, but no later than 14 business days
from the date we receive your Counter Notification, unless our Copyright Agent first receives notice
from the party filing the original Notification informing us that such party has filed a court
action to restrain you from engaging in infringing activity related to the material in question. If
you materially misrepresent that the disabled or removed content was removed by mistake or
misidentification, you may be liable for damages, including costs and attorney's fees. Filing a
false Counter Notification constitutes perjury.

        TERMS OF USE FOR RESTAURANTS
    </strong>
</p>

<p>
    Version Date: 10.10.2013
</p>

<p>
    This Terms of Use agreement ("Agreement") constitutes a legally binding agreement made between
    you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity ("you" or the "Restaurant") and Foodpal, LLC
    and its affiliated companies (collectively, "Foodpal "), concerning access to and use of
    <a href="http://www.foodpal.com/">
        www.foodpal.com
    </a>
    as well as any other related media form or channel (collectively, the "Website").  The Website
    allows Restaurants to advertise their menus and receive food orders for delivery or pickup (the
    "Foodpal Services"). The Foodpal Services are hosted in the United States.
</p>

<p>
    THE RESTAURANT ACCEPTS AND AGREES TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT BY ACKNOWLEDGING SUCH ACCEPTANCE
    DURING THE REGISTRATION OR OTHER ACCEPTANCE PROCESS AND ALSO BY CONTINUING TO USE THE FOODPAL
    SERVICES.  IF THE RESTAURANT DOES NOT AGREE TO ABIDE BY THIS AGREEMENT, OR TO FUTURE
    MODIFICATIONS FOODPAL MAY MAKE TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE RESTAURANT SHOULD NOT ACCESS OR CONTINUE
    TO USE OR ACCESS THE FOODPAL SERVICES OR THE WEBSITE AND THE RESTAURANT WILL NOTIFY FOODPAL IN
    WRITING VIA E-MAIL WITHIN 24 HOURS THAT IT IS TERMINATING ITS PRESENCE ON THE WEBSITE AND WILL
    NO LONGER ACCEPT ORDERS.
</p>

<p>
    The Restaurant agrees to: (a) provide true, accurate, current, and complete information about
    the Restaurant as prompted by the Website's registration process and (b) maintain and promptly
    update registration data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete.  If the Restaurant
    provides any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Foodpal has
    reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or
    incomplete, Foodpal has the right to suspend or terminate the Restaurant's account and refuse
    any and all current or future use of the Website and the Foodpal Services (or any portion
    thereof).
</p>

<p>
    <strong>
        MARKETING SERVICES
    </strong>
</p>

<p>
    Foodpal will perform a variety of marketing activities to promote the Restaurant and the
    Restaurant's menu.  The marketing activities will be determined in Foodpal’s discretion.  The
    marketing activities undertaken are described on the Website, and may be changed at anytime in
    Foodpal 's discretion, without notice. Foodpal does not charge the Restaurant directly for
    marketing activities and Foodpal only receives compensation from the Restaurant based upon
    actual customer orders, as further described below.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>
        MENUS AND MARKETING MATERIALS
    </strong>
</p>

<p>
    The Restaurant will provide Foodpal with the Restaurant's current menu, in the format required
    by Foodpal, and any other materials requested by Foodpal (collectively, the "Marketing
    Materials"). If the Restaurant modifies its menu, it will promptly provide Foodpal with an
    updated menu.  Foodpal may post an image of the menu, transcribe the menu's content, and/or use
    photographs or other images of menu items or the Restaurant, as determined by Foodpal. By
    providing Foodpal with Marketing Materials, the Restaurant grants, and represents that it has
    the right to grant, to Foodpal a non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free, fully-paid,
    worldwide license to use, copy, publicly perform, publicly display, reformat, translate, excerpt
    (in whole or in part) and distribute such Marketing Materials, including any trademarks, trade
    names, service marks, logos, telephone numbers, and addresses therein, for any purpose in
    connection with the Website and the Foodpal Services, or the promotion thereof performed
    directly by Foodpal or indirectly through any advertising channels selected by Foodpal.  The use
    and distribution may occur in any media formats and channels for the purpose of publishing and
    promoting your Marketing Materials in connection with services offered or to be offered by
    Foodpal.  Such use and distribution license will apply to any form, media, or technology. 
    Foodpal does not assert any ownership over Marketing Materials. The Restaurant retains full
    ownership of its Marketing Materials and any rights associated with them.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>
        ORDERS
    </strong>
</p>

<p>
    Customers may place orders with Foodpal via the Website, or other means as may be determined by
    Foodpal. When an order is placed, Foodpal’s system automatically sends a fax or e-mail to the
    Restaurant.  The Restaurant then receives a phone call from Foodpal’s automatic confirmation
    system, requesting confirmation of receipt of the order by entering a confirmation code or
    clicking confirmation button unique to each order.  If Foodpal at any time decides to record
    these telephone calls, the Restaurant consents to such recording and shall notify its employees
    that such telephone calls are recorded.  The Restaurant must have all customers sign the order
    confirmation form that Foodpal provides to the Restaurant and the Restaurant agrees to retain a
    copy of these signed forms for a minimum period of 3 months. The Restaurant will promptly
    deliver to Foodpal copies of these forms upon request.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>
        PAYMENT
    </strong>
</p>

<p>
    When customers place orders, they will generally be charged directly by Foodpal via a credit or
    debit card.  On occasion, the Restaurant may charge customers either when credit or debit card
    information is provided to the Restaurant by Foodpal, or when a customer prefers to pay the
    Restaurant in cash or by check. If the Restaurant has requested Foodpal to fax or e-mail to the
    customers' credit card information, then the Restaurant agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
    Foodpal from and against any damages, losses, costs and expenses that Foodpal may incur arising
    from such transfer, whether arising from claims by a credit card company, government agency,
    customer or otherwise.
</p>

<p>
    When Foodpal charges customers, Foodpal will deduct the commission percentage or flat fee and a
    payment processing fee, as listed on the Website or otherwise notified to the Restaurant.  The
    Commission Percentage shall be calculated based on the charges for food ordered, and shall not
    be calculated based on charges associated with delivery fees, tips, or taxes. Foodpal may change
    the Commission Percentage and the payment processing fee at anytime upon posting such changes to
    the Website, or notifying the Restaurant.  The balance after deductions for the Commission
    Percentage and the payment processing fees shall be transferred to the Restaurant on a weekly
    basis via direct bank deposit or check, as determined by Foodpal.
</p>

<p>
    In cases where the Restaurant receives payment from a customer, Foodpal will invoice the
    Restaurant on a monthly basis for the Commission Percentage due. Such amounts will either be
    deducted from amounts owed by Foodpal to the Restaurant or shall be paid by the Restaurant to
    Foodpal via credit card or check, as determined by Foodpal.  If the Restaurant is required to
    pay an invoice, the the invoice shall be paid within 15 days of receipt.  Late payments will be
    charged interest equal to one percent (1%) per month until paid in full.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>
        TAXES
    </strong>
</p>

<p>
    The Restaurant is responsible for all liability associated with the computation and payment of
    sales tax to the applicable taxing authorities.  The Restaurant shall be solely responsible for
    verifying the amount collected, filing the appropriate sales tax returns, and remitting the
    proper amount to the appropriate taxing authorities. Sales tax shall include any sales, use,
    privilege, gross receipts, restaurant, excise or other tax due in relation to the sale of food
    or drink by the Restaurant.
</p>
